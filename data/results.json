    "response": "Answer: D\nExplanation: According to ICD-10-CM guidelines, when a patient presents with both an acute and a chronic condition, the condition that is primarily being treated or managed during the visit should be sequenced first. This approach ensures that the focus of care is accurately reflected in the medical coding. None of the specific codes listed (E10.9, M17.1, J01.11, I10, 99213) directly relate to the general guideline question, but the guideline itself is applicable universally across conditions."

In this scenario, although the patient was initially admitted with a high fever, the diagnosis of sepsis, which is a more specific and severe condition, would be considered the primary reason for hospitalization once it is identified.
